# Essay Site

username: hello

password: world

A fully responsive, password protected, website to display essays and link to criteria using react tabs.

I created this site for my apprenticeship in Software Development, I wanted to display my essays in website format, so criteria could be linked to, and easily found. I also wanted to solve the issue of having image that were too small on a word document, on the website, you can hover and the image will grow larger so you can read it.

As I wasn't allowed to share the code I produced at my employment, I had to password protect the site, so only the examiner would be able to access.

A request to server (hosted on heroku) made to check password and username match before logging in to view the site.

The site is built using React, along wit Tailwind CSS. It's quite a basic site, so not much prior knowledge is needed but you will need to have both installed.

Please feel free to use this as a template, or extract any of the things you like.

Some useful features are:

Scroll to top - this component scrolls to the top of the page when it is rendered, I found that it was opening each page at the bottom, previously.

Navigation - The nav bar changes from words to icons when the browser width decreases. This is great for mobiles/tablets, and makes good use of React Hooks useEffect.
